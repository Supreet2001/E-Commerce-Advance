##  🧑🏻‍  About Me

I'm a full stack developer. I spent the last four months working both as a freelance web developer and designer. I acquired project and time management skills, as well as the ability to communicate. I have worked on a multitude of web and print based projects for a range of clients providing Web Design (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign) and Development (PHP, HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, ReactJS, WordPress, Bootstrap, Responsive Layouts), eCommerce Solutions and Graphic Design. I also take interest in Editing. Photography is my passion - nature is my refuge. Combine the two, and that is where I am most at peace.
